# Text Editor

## Description
 - I built a browser-based text editor that meets the criteria of a Progressive Web App (PWA). The editor can be used offline because it uses both localStorage and an IndexedDB database. Creating this project allowed me to practice the fundamentals of PWAs using webpack, including custom service workers and a manifest.json file.
