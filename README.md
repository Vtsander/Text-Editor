# Text Editor

## Description
 - I built a browser-based text editor that meets the criteria of a Progressive Web App (PWA). The editor can be used offline because it uses both localStorage and an IndexedDB database. Creating this project allowed me to practice the fundamentals of PWAs using webpack, including custom service workers and a manifest.json file.

## Usage
 - Navigate to the root directory of the project in your terminal and install the dependencies with 'npm i' then start the server with npm start. The application will be deployed on your localhost with port 3000. When you first start the application you should see something similar to the image below. You can now use the text editor and it will save all changes you make automatically as you make changes to it.
